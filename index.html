> ðŸ‘‹ Hello 

I am a third year PhD student in Physics, supervised by Doctors Lucia Reining and Matteo Gatti at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. 

My research is focused on systems of interacting electrons. In order to understand such systems we need high-throughput calculations which are mostly based on density-functional theory (DFT). DFT tells us that all observables are functionals of the ground state electronic density. However, the exact functionals are not known and one has to find approximation. The aim of my PhD is to develop explicit density functionals using connector approach. The power of this new approach is to profit from calculations that are performed once and for all in model systems.
