title: Hi, I'm Ayoub
subtitle: TI am a third year PhD student in Mathematics supervised by Doctors Julie Josse and Claire Boyer at Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP) and University Pierre and Marie Curie (LPSM).

My research is focused on the estimation of high dimensional incomplete matrices, which contain missing data generated by the specific MAR and MNAR mechanisms. The key issue is to perform predictive models for public health applications with the APHP Traumabase Group.
